   <p>I'm a Software Developer and UI designer currently working at HealthAide. When I'm not hard at work I'm cuddling with my dog, playing video games or (more often than not) a bit of both. In my off time I enjoy building and creating in many ways, from Lego and puzzles to coding my own fun little projects.</p>
